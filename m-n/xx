							With private Medical Insurance, you can also access a range of private hospitals. You have

						</p>
						<p>
							People choose Private Medical Insurance, sometimes called PMI, for a variety of reasons. It
							could be that you're starting a family and want the best care for your children. Or you just
							want to know that you'll get quick access to healthcare when you need it. Alternatively, for
							those in later life, there's the reassurance of speedy diagnosis, advanced treatments, as
							well as being given priority for knee and hip replacements. What's more, you'll get your own
							en-suite room during any recovery stay.
						</p>
						<p>
							So, when's the best time to compare your private healthcare options? Right now. Most medical
							plans exclude pre-existing conditions, which means you should consider the merits of private
							care when you're healthy. And if you then need treatment for illness or injury, you'll have
							the peace of mind of knowing that it'll be available without the need to queue. There's no
							obligation to take out a policy when you get a quote, but it's always wise to know your
							options.

							starting a family and seeking top-notch care for your children, desiring prompt access to

							Wondering when is the ideal time to explore your private healthcare options? The answer is

				Frequently Asked Questions
			</h2>
			<div class="faqs">
				<div class="faq-item mb-4">
					<h3>
						Can I get cover for my pre-existing conditions?
					</h3>
					<p>
						Generally speaking, pre-existing conditions are not covered by private health insurance.
						However, it isn’t impossible. Whether your conditions are covered depends entirely on your
						individual circumstances and so it is always best to discuss this with an expert. Fill in your
						details on our form and someone will be in touch to discuss your options.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item mb-4">
					<h3>
						Can I get cover for my family too?
					</h3>
					<p>
						Yes, it is possible. Similar to individual health insurance, family health insurance works by
						having one policy that might cover you, your partner, and your children. This is rather than
						purchasing multiple plans for each member of your family. Depending on your situation and the
						insurer, a family health insurance policy may cover different things, but in general, it will
						cover medically essential inpatient, outpatient, and day-patient procedures. Pre-existing
						diseases, childbirth, and cosmetic surgery are frequently not covered by private health
						insurance.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="faq-item">
					<h3>
						Is optical and dental care included?
					</h3>
					<p>
						Depending on the specifics of your policy, private health insurance may or may not cover optical
						and dental care. Some insurers may offer coverage as part of your plan only up to a specified
						amount. Others may not offer any coverage at all. You might be able to add optical and dental
						care as an add-on with some insurers for an additional fee as well.
